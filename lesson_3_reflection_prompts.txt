When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In order to share with other people.
In order to work from different computers and places.
In order to have a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do not want to disrupt what I'm working on.
My current changes may not be ready for a merge.
I may want to create a new branch before a pull.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: making a copy of another repository.  The new repository is disconnected from the old repository.
Clone: making a copy of another repository.  The 2 copies are connected, and can push/pull from each other.
Branch: within a repository, making a "copy" of the code.  The 2 copies can be merged.
