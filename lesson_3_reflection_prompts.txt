When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In order to share with other people.
In order to work from different computers and places.
In order to have a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do not want to disrupt what I'm working on.
My current changes may not be ready for a merge.
I may want to create a new branch before a pull.
